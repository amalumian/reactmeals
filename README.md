# ReactMeals

ReactMeals is a website that implements the ability to add items to a shopping cart, from where you can checkout via a form (input validation added), after which the items that were added to the cart and the data from the form are sent to the Firebase database. In addition, existing items on the page appear through a request to the database, where information about them is stored in a json file.
